# R_For_Data_Science

Here I provide a pdf of the R for Data Science 2e book, hopefully helpful for a few. It may have minor erorrs when compared to the online version, but the benefit may be worth it to some. 

This repo is primarily for me to practice getting familiar with the tidyverse after having gotten familiar with base R fairly well. It is also to help keep my github skills in use.
